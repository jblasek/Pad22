## Welcome to PAD-22
PAD-22 is Perkiomen Valley's App Design class. The first year it started was in the 2019-2020 school year. The class is taught by Mr. Pennebacker. 
<br/>
The first year of App Design, the PAD-22 team decided to make an app specific to PV. It helps students and teachers so that whatever they do daily is made easier through the app. They have features like a map around the school, HAC, virtual Hall pass, announcements, and etc.
