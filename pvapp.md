# The Perkiomen Valley App
The Perkiomen Valley App is being made for the purpose to help fix many of the issues that are commonly found in the Valley. This app specifically wants to tackle the topic of centralizing the needs and wants of the Perkiomen students. 


## Home
The home page of the PV app will contain a calendar to see important news that is general to PV and there will be a schedule section. The schedule section will include club meeting times, library times, etc.

### Why a home page?
In the student survey that was conducted, there was a question that asked what feature the students would want to see the most. The majority of reponses wanted a central location for schedules. As a student, it can be hard to find one specific announcement through an email or during PVTV/the announcements over the intercom system. If a student wants to find when the irst meeting of math club is, they can go to the calendar and look to see when math club is having its meeting.

## Digital Deli
The Digital Deli system will allow users the oppurtunity to order their deli for lunch in advance. This will also let users see their current balance, as well as add to it. 


### Why a digital deli
In our student survey, many responses were heard which spoke of struggles in the lunch line. There were many complaints about long wait times, and entering your lunch code. The PV Deli will help fix this by letting students order their lunch online through the app. 


## Navigator
The navigator feature will create a basic replica of the school that will specifically show class rooms. There will be a feature where a starting classroom and a destination classroom are inputed and the fastest route will be calculated.

### Why a navigator?
Many 9th graders coming into the highschool understand where their classes are but do not know how to get there in a reasonable time. The map will get rid of this issue by finding a fast route to their class. The map is going to be very basic, and only show hallways and where the front door of the classroom is. The user can select there current location and then the destination they want to go to. The app will calculate a route and the student can follow it.
