# The Perkiomen Valley App
The Perkiomen Valley App is being made for the purpose to help fix many of the issues that are commonly found in the Valley. This app specifically wants to tackle the topic of centralizing the needs and wants of the Perkiomen students. 


## Home
```markdown
The home page of the PV app will contain a calendar to see important 
news that is general to PV and there will be a schedule section. The 
schedule section will include club meeting times, library times, etc.
```

### Why a home page?
```markdown
In the student survey that was conducted, there was a question that 
asked what feature the students would want to see the most. The 
majority of reponses wanted a central location for schedules. As a 
student, it can be hard to find one specific announcement through an 
email or during PVTV/the announcements over the intercom system. If 
a student wants to find when the irst meeting of math club is, they 
can go to the calendar and look to see when math club is having its
meeting.
```
## Digital Deli
```markdown
The Digital Deli system will allow users the oppurtunity to order
their deli for lunch in advance. This will also let users see their 
current balance, as well as add to it.
```
### Why a digital deli
```markdown
In our student survey, many responses were heard which spoke of 
struggles in the lunch line. There were many complaints about long 
wait times, and entering your lunch code. The PV Deli will help fix
this by letting students order their lunch online through the app. 
```

## Navigator
```markdown
The navigator feature will create a basic replica of the school that 
will specifically show class rooms. There will be a feature where a 
starting classroom and a destination classroom are inputed and the 
fastest route will be calculated.
```
### Why a navigator?
```markdown
Many 9th graders coming into the highschool understand where their 
classes are but do not know how to get there in a reasonable time. 
The map will get rid of this issue by finding a fast route to their 
class. The map is going to be very basic, and only show hallways and
where the front door of the classroom is. The user can select there 
current location and then the destination they want to go to. The app
will calculate a route and the student can follow it. 
```
## Personal Profiles
```markdown
Personal profiles will be used to dipsplay useful information to the
student. It will have the ability to incorporate home access center 
for easy grade access, show debt to the school, etc. (We should use a 
system where we can have it display library books that a student has 
and give them the due date/fine for it)
```
### Why personal profiles?
```markdown
A personal profile will give very useful information to a student that 
is very easy to use and follow. It also puts all of the information
into one space and adds other features that have not been inplemented 
into the school before. This will allow for a better school experience
and less money that the parents will owe to the school.
```
## ID
```markdown
The ID section of our app will create a virtual identification for the 
student. It wil be used for going out in the hallways, paying for lunch, 
checking out library book, etc.
```
### Why an ID?
```markdown
There is a tendency for many students to shy away from using their IDs. 
A lot of the student body does not like wearing their ID and will 
commonly forget it in various locations. Having a virtual ID kept
inside of the app will ensure that the student can use a valid ID 
and paper will not have to be wasted for replacements. The ID will 
also have other uses that will speed up the process of other common 
school tasks.
