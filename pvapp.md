# The Perkiomen Valley App
The Perkiomen Valley App is being made for the purpose to help fix many of the issues that are commonly found in the Valley. This app specifically wants to tackle the topic of centralizing the needs and wants of the Perkiomen students. 


## Home
The home page of the PV app will contain a calendar to see important news that is general to PV and there will be a schedule section. The schedule section will include club meeting times, library times, etc.

### Why a home page?
In the student survey that was conducted, there was a question that asked what feature the students would want to see the most. The majority of reponses wanted a central location for schedules. As a student, it can be hard to find one specific announcement through an email or during PVTV/the announcements over the intercom system. If a student wants to find when the irst meeting of math club is, they can go to the calendar and look to see when math club is having its meeting.
